# Orchestrator Reference

This document defines the subagent orchestration logic used by the work skill when a plan has 3+ tasks. It is NOT a standalone skill — it is referenced by `skills/work/SKILL.md` Phase 2.5.

> **Scope distinction:** This document handles work-specific orchestration (dependency resolution, worktree isolation, merge procedure). For general-purpose agent team assembly and delegation, see `skills/orchestrate-agents/SKILL.md`.

---

## 0. Workspace and Ledger

Orchestration keeps its state on disk, not in the session. A run that is compacted, interrupted, or resumed reads that state back rather than remembering it.

### Workspace layout

```
.claude/work/<plan-basename>/
  progress.md          -- the ledger
  task-<N>-brief.md    -- one task's requirements, extracted from the plan
  task-<N>-report.md   -- that task's full report, written by the subagent
```

`<plan-basename>` is the loaded plan file's name without `.md`. `skills/work/SKILL.md` Phase 2.5 resolves the workspace before handing off. A run with no plan file takes `adhoc-<slug>` as its basename, slugified from the task description -- every run has a workspace and a ledger, because every dispatch step below requires one.

### Identity line

The first line of `progress.md`, exactly one:

```
# work ledger -- plan: <full plan file path>
```

When the run has no plan file, the task description takes the place of the path on that same line.

### Ledger grammar

Every other line of `progress.md` is one of exactly these seven forms:

```
Group <G>: dispatched (<task numbers>)
Task <N> [<task title>]: complete (branch <branch>, commits <base7>..<head7>)
Task <N> [<task title>]: blocked -- <one-line reason>
Task <N> [<task title>]: failed -- <one-line reason>
Task <N>: merged
Group <G>: merged (<task numbers>, no conflicts)
Group <G>: merge stopped -- conflict in <file list>
```

`Task <N>: merged` records one branch landing. `Group <G>: merged (...)` summarizes the whole group and is written only after every branch in it has landed, so it cannot stand in for the per-task line.

This section is the single source of truth for the grammar. Section 2 and Section 3 append these lines; they do not redefine them.

### Resume rules

At the start of orchestration, read `.claude/work/<plan-basename>/progress.md`:

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No file, or a file whose first line is not a `# work ledger -- plan:` identity line | Fresh run. Create the directory if needed, overwrite the file with the identity line. Do not suffix -- a directory with no identity claims no plan. |
| First line names this plan file, and every completion line's task number and title match the plan | Resumable. Do not re-dispatch any task carrying a `complete` line. Merge a completed task's branch unless a `Task <N>: merged` line also exists for it -- a `complete` line records that the work was done, not that it landed. A complete line reading `commits none` has no branch to merge. Resume dispatch at the first task with no matching `complete` line. |
| First line names a different plan file | Leave that directory untouched. Retry at `.claude/work/<plan-basename>-2/`, then `-3`, and so on, until a directory is found that either does not exist or whose identity line names this plan file. Use that one for the whole run. Print one line naming the directory actually used and why. |
| First line matches this plan file, but a completion line's task title does not match the plan's task at that number, or names a task number the plan does not have | The plan changed mid-run. Warn the user, treat the ledger as stale, and start fresh in the same directory. |

### Cleanup

The workspace is deleted by `skills/work/SKILL.md` Phase 5 after a successful run, never by the orchestrator. A run that ends blocked, failed, or cancelled leaves the directory in place -- that is what makes the next invocation resumable.

### Write discipline

Every ledger append is followed by reading the file back to confirm the line landed (skill rule L3). A ledger write that cannot be verified is reported to the user and orchestration stops -- an unverifiable ledger makes resume unsound.

---

## 1. Dependency Resolution

Dependency resolution determines the order in which tasks execute. It runs three steps, then builds execution groups.

### Step 1 — Explicit Dependencies

Read each task's `blockedBy` field from the plan. This field lists task numbers that must complete before this task can start.

Example plan fragment:

```yaml
- id: 1
  title: Create database schema
  blockedBy: []

- id: 2
  title: Build API endpoints
  blockedBy: [1]

- id: 3
  title: Add input validation
  blockedBy: [1]

- id: 4
  title: Write integration tests
  blockedBy: [2, 3]
```

Here, Tasks 2 and 3 both wait for Task 1. Task 4 waits for both 2 and 3.

### Step 2 — File Overlap Detection

Compare each pair of tasks' file lists to detect implicit dependencies. If two tasks modify the same file, the later task (by plan order) implicitly depends on the earlier one.

**Algorithm:**

1. Extract file paths from each task's `Files:` section — include all lines under `Create:`, `Modify:`, and `Test:`.
2. For each pair `(i, j)` where `i < j`:
   - Compute the intersection: `intersection(files[i], files[j])`
   - If the intersection is non-empty AND task `j` does not already depend on task `i` (directly or transitively), add `i` to task `j`'s `blockedBy`.
3. Transitive check: task `j` already depends on task `i` transitively if there is any chain `j → ... → i` in the existing dependency graph. Do not add redundant edges.

**Example:**

```
Task 1 — Files: src/models/user.ts, src/db/schema.ts
Task 2 — Files: src/api/users.ts, src/middleware/auth.ts
Task 3 — Files: src/api/users.ts, src/api/admin.ts
```

Tasks 2 and 3 both touch `src/api/users.ts`. Since 2 < 3, Task 3 gets an implicit `blockedBy: [2]`. Tasks 1 and 2 share no files, so no implicit dependency is added between them.

### Step 3 — Build Execution Groups

After resolving all dependencies (explicit + implicit), partition tasks into execution groups:

- **Group 0:** Tasks with no `blockedBy` — these start immediately, in parallel.
- **Group 1:** Tasks whose `blockedBy` entries are all in Group 0.
- **Group N:** Tasks whose `blockedBy` entries are all in Groups 0 through N-1.

Tasks within the same group run in parallel. Groups execute sequentially (Group 0 completes before Group 1 starts).

### Reporting the Graph

Before dispatching, print the execution plan so the user can see what will happen:

```
Dependency Graph:
  Group 0 (parallel): Task 1 [Create database schema]
  Group 1 (parallel): Task 2 [Build API endpoints], Task 3 [Add input validation]
  Group 2 (parallel): Task 4 [Write integration tests]

Dependencies:
  Task 2 → blocked by Task 1 (explicit)
  Task 3 → blocked by Task 1 (explicit)
  Task 4 → blocked by Task 2, Task 3 (explicit)

Dispatching Group 0...
```

## 2. Subagent Dispatch

### Prompt Template

The dispatch is a file handoff, not a paste. The task's requirements go to disk as a brief; the prompt carries the path.

**Part 1 -- the brief.** Before dispatching task N:

1. Write `.claude/work/<plan-basename>/task-<N>-brief.md` with the Write tool, containing the task's own text extracted from the plan -- title, description, acceptance criteria, and file list (Create / Modify / Test, exact paths) -- plus the plan header's architecture context. When the run has no plan file, the brief carries that task's slice of the task description and the file list resolved for it -- the brief is the subagent's only source of requirements either way. Read the file back to confirm it was written (skill rule L3).
2. Delete any existing `task-<N>-report.md` for this task number, then confirm it is gone (L3). The report path is fixed per task, so on a resumed or retried run a report from the previous attempt is already there; leaving it would let the orchestrator read a stale report as if the new subagent had written it. The delete is the entire mitigation for that hazard, so an unverified delete reintroduces the defect it exists to close.

**Part 2 -- the dispatch prompt.** The prompt carries no plan prose. Its context section is exactly three items -- the plan preamble, other tasks' text, and summaries of completed tasks are all excluded:

```
Task {N} of {total}, execution group {G}.

Your requirements are in .claude/work/<plan-basename>/task-{N}-brief.md. Read it first.
It lists the files you may create, modify, and test.

Write your full account to .claude/work/<plan-basename>/task-{N}-report.md.

## Instructions
1. Read all files listed in the brief to understand current state and existing patterns.
2. Implement the changes described, following the codebase's existing conventions.
3. Run the project's test suite after implementation.
4. Self-review your changes: check for missing edge cases, naming consistency, and adherence to acceptance criteria.
5. Commit each logical unit on your worktree branch, then report every commit on a COMMITS line. If the tree already matched the spec and there was nothing to commit, return no COMMITS line.

## Constraints
- Only modify the files listed in the brief. If you discover a needed change in another file, report it as a blocker instead of making the change.
- Follow existing code patterns (naming, structure, error handling).
- Do not add AI attribution comments or generated-by markers.
- If you encounter an ambiguity or need a decision from the user, report BLOCKED status with a clear description of what you need.
```

**Return contract.** The agent's final text is data, not prose. It writes its full account -- what it implemented, what it tested, files changed, self-review findings, concerns -- to the report path, and returns only these lines, in this order:

```
STATUS | DONE | BLOCKED | FAILED
BRANCH | <branch name>
BASE | <short sha of the branch point>
COMMITS | <short sha> <subject>                 (zero or more lines, one per commit)
TESTS | <one line>
REASON | <one line, only when STATUS is not DONE>
REPORT | <path to task-<N>-report.md>
```

`COMMITS` is one line per commit rather than a pipe-delimited list, because a commit subject can contain `|` and the field separator would then be ambiguous. `<base7>` in Section 0's `complete` line is the `BASE` value; `<head7>` is the short sha on the last `COMMITS` line. When there is no `COMMITS` line the task changed nothing to commit -- write `commits none` in place of `commits <base7>..<head7>` and merge no branch for that task.

Anything beyond these lines is ignored. The detail belongs in the report file, which the orchestrator reads only when it needs it -- that is what keeps a run's controller context a function of the number of tasks rather than the size of the work each task did.

### Dispatch Mechanics

For each execution group, in order:

1. **Write the briefs:** For each task in the group, write its `task-<N>-brief.md` and delete any stale `task-<N>-report.md`, per Prompt Template Part 1. Both writes are read back before the group dispatches.
2. **Create tracking entries:** Call `TaskCreate` for each task in the group, recording task title, status `IN_PROGRESS`, and assigned group number.
3. **Spawn agents:** For each task, spawn one Agent with:
   - `subagent_type="general-purpose"`
   - `isolation="worktree"` (each agent works in its own git worktree)
   - `run_in_background=true`
   - The filled-in prompt template as the agent's instructions.
4. **Record the dispatch:** Append `Group <G>: dispatched (<task numbers>)` to the ledger and read the file back to confirm the line landed. `TaskCreate` remains the live in-session view and the ledger is the durable record; the two are complementary, not redundant, and neither replaces the other.
5. **Wait for group completion:** Wait for all agents in the current group to finish. Never call `ScheduleWakeup` as a fallback in case a notification is missed -- the harness always notifies on completion, and a fallback wakeup past the 5-minute prompt-cache TTL forces a full-context reprocess for no benefit.
6. **Process results:** Collect each agent's output and determine status (see Result Collection below).
7. **Update tracking:** Call `TaskUpdate` for each task with its final status.
8. **Proceed to next group:** If all tasks in the current group are DONE or if independent tasks in the next group are unblocked, move to the next group.

### Result Collection

Status is read from the return contract's `STATUS` line, not from the prose of a summary. Every ledger append below is verified by reading the file back.

| Status | Detection | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **DONE** | `STATUS \| DONE` | Append `Task <N> [<task title>]: complete (branch <branch>, commits <base7>..<head7>)`, taking `<branch>` from `BRANCH`, `<base7>` from `BASE`, and `<head7>` from the short sha on the last `COMMITS` line. With no `COMMITS` line, write `commits none` and queue no branch. Otherwise queue the branch for merge. Do not read the report file. |
| **BLOCKED** | `STATUS \| BLOCKED` | Append `Task <N> [<task title>]: blocked -- <one-line reason>`, taking the reason from `REASON`. Read the report file at `REPORT` for the detail. Pause dependents, report to the user. |
| **FAILED** | `STATUS \| FAILED` | Append `Task <N> [<task title>]: failed -- <one-line reason>`, taking the reason from `REASON`. Read the report file at `REPORT` for the detail. Pause dependents, report to the user. |

An agent that returns nothing -- killed on a terminal error, or skipped -- is neither blocked nor complete. Append no ledger line for it. The absent `complete` line is what makes the next invocation re-dispatch it cleanly.

**When a report file is read.** The orchestrator reads a `task-<N>-report.md` only on a BLOCKED or FAILED status, or when post-merge validation points at that task. A DONE task's report is written and never opened.

**Handling BLOCKED/FAILED tasks:**

- All tasks that have a direct or transitive dependency on a BLOCKED/FAILED task are paused — they do not dispatch.
- Tasks in the same or later groups that are independent of the failed task continue normally.
- The orchestrator reports the situation to the user and waits for guidance before retrying paused tasks.

## 3. Merge Procedure

### Merge Order

Merge branches in topological order — a task's branch merges only after all of its dependencies have merged. Within the same execution group, merge in plan order (lower task ID first).

### Per-Branch Merge

For each completed task branch, in topological order:

1. Run `git merge <worktree-branch> --no-edit` into the working branch.
2. **Auto-merge succeeds:** Append `Task <N>: merged` to the ledger and read it back, before moving on -- a branch that landed must be recorded at the moment it lands, not once its group finishes. Continue to the next branch. Clean up the worktree. Once the whole group's branches have merged, append `Group <G>: merged (<task numbers>, no conflicts)` to the ledger and read it back.
3. **Conflict detected:** Stop the merge sequence immediately. Append `Group <G>: merge stopped -- conflict in <file list>` to the ledger, then report to the user with:
   - The conflicting file list (from `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`)
   - Which task branches have merged so far
   - Which task branches remain unmerged

Each branch that landed carries its own `Task <N>: merged` line, so the "which task branches have merged so far" item is read from the ledger rather than from memory -- including after a compaction, when memory is gone and the group line has not been written.

Do not attempt automatic conflict resolution. The user must resolve conflicts before the merge sequence continues.

### Post-Merge Validation

After all branches have merged successfully:

1. Run the project's full test suite on the merged result.
2. If tests pass, report success.
3. If tests fail, report the failures with:
   - Which tests failed
   - Likely responsible task (based on which files the failing tests cover)
   - Suggestion: re-run the responsible task's agent with the test failure as context.

   Read that task's `task-<N>-report.md` for the detail before reporting. This is the third and last case where a report file is read.

---

## 4. Progress Reporting

The printed tables are a view, not the state. After a context compaction the ledger at `.claude/work/<plan-basename>/progress.md` is the authority for what has been dispatched, completed, and merged; rebuild the table from it rather than from anything remembered.

### At Start

When orchestration begins, report:

```
Orchestrating {N} tasks across {M} execution groups.
```

Print the dependency graph using the format shown in "Reporting the Graph" above, then announce dispatching the first group.

### During Execution

Use `TaskCreate` and `TaskUpdate` calls to maintain real-time status. Each task transitions through:

```
PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → DONE | BLOCKED | FAILED
```

When a group completes, announce it before dispatching the next:

```
Group 0 complete. All tasks DONE.
  Task 1: 47 passed, 0 failed.
  Task 2: 12 passed, 0 failed.
Dispatching Group 1 (2 tasks in parallel)...
```

Print each task's `TESTS` line from the return contract in the group-completion announcement. That is the one place `TESTS` is consumed, and it is why the field is in the contract.

### At End — Success

When all tasks complete successfully and merge cleanly:

```
All tasks complete.

| Task | Title                    | Status | Branch                    |
|------|--------------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| 1    | Create database schema   | DONE   | work/1-database-schema    |
| 2    | Build API endpoints      | DONE   | work/2-api-endpoints      |
| 3    | Add input validation     | DONE   | work/3-input-validation   |
| 4    | Write integration tests  | DONE   | work/4-integration-tests  |

Merge: All 4 branches merged successfully.
Tests: 47 passed, 0 failed.
```

### At End — Partial Failure

When some tasks fail or are blocked:

```
Orchestration paused — 1 task blocked, 1 task not started.

| Task | Title                    | Status      | Branch                    |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 1    | Create database schema   | DONE        | work/1-database-schema    |
| 2    | Build API endpoints      | DONE        | work/2-api-endpoints      |
| 3    | Add input validation     | BLOCKED     | work/3-input-validation   |
| 4    | Write integration tests  | NOT STARTED | —                         |

Blocker (Task 3): "Validation rules not specified in plan — need user input on email format requirements."

Merged so far: Task 1, Task 2.
Awaiting: Resolve Task 3 blocker, then Task 3 and Task 4 can proceed.
```
