!`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_GIT"`

# Senior Review

Run a pragmatic senior developer code review -- evaluating structural decisions, code quality, risk areas, and language conventions through a team lead lens.

**Announce:** "Using the senior-review skill for a pragmatic code review."

---

## Step 0 -- Git Availability

If any gather-context block above returned `NO_GIT`, this directory is not a git repository.
Print: `> No git repository detected. /senior-review requires a git repo.`
**Stop here.**

## Step 0.5 -- Input Validation

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty AND there is no conversation context about what to review (no prior diff discussion, no files mentioned), print:

> Usage: `/senior-review [--quick] [#PR_NUMBER | PR_URL]`
>
> Options:
> - `--quick` -- Single-pass review (faster, same quality bar)
> - `#123` or PR URL -- Review a specific pull request
> - No arguments -- Prompted to select diff source

**Stop here.**

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty but conversation context exists (e.g., user was just discussing a diff), proceed -- use the contextual diff.

---

## Step 1 -- Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

- Contains `--quick` --> set mode to `quick`, remove flag from remaining arguments
- Contains `#NNN` (hash + digits) --> set source to `pr`, extract PR number
- Contains a URL matching a PR/MR pattern (github.com/.../pull/NNN, gitlab.com/.../-/merge_requests/NNN) --> set source to `pr`, extract URL
- Otherwise --> source is unset (will prompt in Step 2)

---

## Step 2 -- Diff Source Selection

If source was set from Step 1 (PR number or URL), skip to Step 3.

If source is unset, infer from context: "this"/"my changes"/"just made" --> `uncommitted`; "branch"/"vs main" --> `branch`. If clear, skip prompt.

Only if intent cannot be inferred, use `AskUserQuestion`:

> What would you like me to review?

Buttons:
- **"Uncommitted changes"** --> source = `uncommitted`
- **"Branch diff (vs main/master)"** --> source = `branch`
- **"Pull Request"** --> source = `pr` (will prompt for PR number)

If user selects "Pull Request" and no PR number was provided, ask:
> Enter the PR number or URL:

---

## Step 3 -- Diff Gathering

| Source | Command | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `uncommitted` | `git diff` + `git diff --staged` | Combine both; stop if both empty: "No uncommitted changes found." |
| `branch` | `git rev-parse --verify main` then `git diff main...HEAD` | Fall back to `master` if `main` missing; stop if empty: "No changes found between current branch and base branch." |
| `pr` | `gh pr diff <pr_number_or_url>` via Bash tool (not `!` block) | Stop if `gh` fails: "Could not fetch PR diff. Ensure `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated." |

Also gather the file list: `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` (for PR source, use `gh pr diff --name-only` or parse diff headers).

---

## Step 4 -- Language Detection

Language detection is handled by the senior-reviewer agent.

---

## Step 5 -- Context7 Lookup (Full Mode Only)

If mode is `quick`, skip this step entirely.

For the detected primary language, query context7 for current conventions. One query, primary language only. Skip if quick mode or context7 unavailable.

---

## Step 6 -- Agent Dispatch

Dispatch `quiver:senior-reviewer` with the following context (in this order):

1. **Full diff** from Step 3.
2. **Changed file list** with detected language(s) from Step 4.
3. **Mode:** `full` or `quick`.
4. **Context7 results** (if available from Step 5, omit if quick mode or unavailable).
5. **Scope reminder:** "Your findings MUST be scoped to code CHANGED in this diff. Reading surrounding code for context is expected; flagging pre-existing issues is not."
6. **Citation accuracy:** "Every file:line reference in your findings must be verified by reading the file. Do not cite line numbers from memory or inference -- use the Read tool to confirm the content at the cited line before including it in a finding."

Do NOT pass pipeline context. This is standalone mode -- Phase 5 (meta-review) must not activate.

---

## Step 7 -- Output

Present the agent's findings in the terminal.

After presenting findings, use `AskUserQuestion`:

> Review complete. What would you like to do?

Buttons:
- **"Save report"** --> Write to `.claude/reports/senior-review-{timestamp}.md` (use `date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S'` format). Confirm with: `> Report saved to {path}`
- **"Done"** --> Stop.

---

## Test Plan

**Trigger:** `/senior-review` (and `/quiver:senior-review`)

**Setup:** Git repo with uncommitted changes or a branch diff; `gh` CLI available for PR mode.

**Expected behavior:**
1. Shell blocks gather git context without errors.
2. `--quick` sets mode and skips context7; `#NNN`/PR URL triggers PR mode directly.
3. Empty arguments with no context prints usage and stops.
4. Diff source selection shows three buttons via AskUserQuestion.
5. Agent dispatch includes all required context items; no pipeline context passed.
6. Save report writes with correct timestamp filename format.

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Slash menu shows `/senior-review`.
- [ ] `--quick` skips context7 and runs single-pass; `#123` and full URL both trigger PR mode.
- [ ] No shell logic in `!` blocks; all shell blocks exit 0.
- [ ] AskUserQuestion used for diff source selection and post-review action.
- [ ] Agent dispatch does NOT include pipeline context; report path uses correct timestamp format.

**Known gotchas:**
- `gh pr diff` requires authentication; skill stops with a clear message on failure rather than continuing with an empty diff.
- Context7 may be unavailable; skill degrades gracefully. Strip `--quick` before PR number parsing to avoid misinterpretation.
